            <p style="font-size:1.5em;">This site was made by someone who feels like they had made no progress in the past 4 years. Reflecting on the past is good and all, but remember to live in the 
                present, looking towards the future. This site is meant to motivate you, but no one can make you actually go out and fulfill your goals.
                Don't let anything stop you from achieving your dreams. When life gets you down, bounce back stronger.
